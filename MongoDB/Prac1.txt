Prac 1 : Create different types that include attributes. Define tables for these types by adding enough tuples. 
         Demonstrate insert, update and delete operations on these tables. 
         Execute queries on them. 

Queries :

## Create EmployeeType
create TYPE EmployeeType AS OBJECT(EmploeeID number,FirstName varchar2(50),LastName varchar2(50),Salary number);
/

# Create DepartmentType
create TYPE DepartmentType AS OBJECT(DepartmentID number,DepartmentName varchar2(50),Location varchar2(50));
/

# CREATE TABLE Employees OF EmployeeType;
create table Employees of EmployeeType;

# CREATE TABLE Departments OF DepartmentType;
create table Departments of DepartmentType;

# Insert data into Employees Table
insert into Employees values(EmployeeType(1,'John','Doe',50000));
insert into Employees values(EmployeeType(2,'Alice','Smith',60000));
insert into Employees values(EmployeeType(3,'Michal','Johnson',55000));
insert into Employees values(EmployeeType(4,'Shail','Tagadghar',60000));
insert into Employees values(EmployeeType(5,'Abhi','Jaiswar',52000));

# Insert data into Departments Table
insert into Departments values(DepartmentType(1,'IT','Mumbai'));
insert into Departments values(DepartmentType(2,'CS','Pune'));
insert into Departments values(DepartmentType(3,'HR','Goregoan'));
insert into Departments values(DepartmentType(4,'Finance','Malad'));
insert into Departments values(DepartmentType(5,'Accountant','Airoli'));

# Retriving / Quering Employees table
select * from Employees;

# Retriving / Quering Departments table
select * from Departments;

# updating employees values
update Employees SET Salary = 55000 where EmploeeID = 1;

# delete employees values
delete from Employees where EmploeeID = 2;

# join employees and departmets tables
select E.EmploeeID,E.FirstName,E.LastName,E.Salary,D.DepartmentName from 
Employees E JOIN Departments D ON E.EmploeeID = D.DepartmentID;

# Find Employees in a Specific Department
select * from Employees where EmploeeID IN (select DepartmentID from Departments where DepartmentName = 'IT');

# Find the Average Salary of Employees
select AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary from Employees;

# Find the Highest Paid Employee
select * from Employees where Salary = (select MAX(Salary) from Employees);

# Count the Number of Employees in Each Department
select D.DepartmentName,COUNT(E.EmploeeID) AS NUmberOFEmployees from 
Employees E JOIN Departments D ON E.EmploeeID = D.DepartmentID GROUP BY D.DepartmentName;

# Update Department Name for a Specific Employees
update Departments SET DepartmentName = 'Human Resource' where DepartmentName = 'HR';

# Find Employees with Salaries Above 55000
select * from Employees where salary > 55000;

# delete employee of specific department

# find employee name start with J
select * from Employees where FirstName LIKE 'J%';
